### Group 2 | Module-1 Project: Probability Theory

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a web-based **3D Simulation** designed to visualize and calculate the probability of satellite collisions in space. It applies core concepts from **Module 1 (Probability Concepts)** to a real-world engineering problem.

## 🧮 Mathematical Concepts Used
1.  **Sample Space (S):** Represented by a $10 \times 10 \times 10$ cubic sector of space.
2.  **Geometric Probability:** Calculating probability based on Volume ($P(E) = \frac{\text{Volume of Sphere}}{\text{Volume of Cube}}$).
3.  **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Using random coordinate generation (`Math.random()`) to simulate thousands of independent satellite launches.
4.  **Law of Large Numbers:** Demonstrating how experimental probability converges to theoretical probability as trials ($N$) increase.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Responsive Design)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Visualization:** Plotly.js (For interactive 3D graphing)
* **Mathematics:** MathJax (For rendering LaTeX formulas)

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
3.  Adjust the sliders to change the number of satellites ($N$) or debris size ($R$).
4.  Click **"Run Simulation"**.
